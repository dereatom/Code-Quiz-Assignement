# Code-Quiz-Assignement
I am taking a code quiz
 Start button as clicked
Questions were answer by click
I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
All questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
